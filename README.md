# TFM – Cloud DevSecOps Pipeline with AI-Based Vulnerability Prioritization
This repository contains the Final Master's Project (TFM) focused on the design and implementation of a cloud-native DevSecOps pipeline with automated security controls and an AI-based vulnerability prioritization module.

Azure is used as a reference implementation, while keeping the architecture cloud-agnostic.
